Building Problem
</h1>
The building problem is inspired by Jiang et al. work "Learning Controllable 3D Level Generators". The goal is to create a building in a 3D space using 4 different type of lego blocks (1x1, 1x3, 3x1, 3x3). All the lego block should be able to be used and the minimum height of the building should be more than 50% of the maximum height of the 3D area.

The problem has 4 variants:
- `building-v0`: generate a 3d building with max size of 6x6x12.
- `building-large-v0`: generate a 3d building with max size of 12x12x12.
- `building-tall-v0`: generate a 3d building with max size of 6x6x24.
- `building-huge-v0`: generate a 3d building with max size of 12x12x24.
